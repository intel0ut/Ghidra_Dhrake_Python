# Ghidra_Dhrake_Python
A Ghidrathon/Python port of Ghidra Dhrake (https://github.com/huettenhain/dhrake) for reverse engineering Delphi binaries.

# Requirements
- [Ghidra]
- [Ghidrathon] 
- [Dhrake]
- Delphi [IDR]. This is used to generate the IDC file used by Dhrake to create the Symbols in Ghidra.

# Install
- Just copy the file to your Ghidra Scripts path, usually ~/ghidra_scripts or $USER_HOME/ghidra_script

# Usage
Ghidra can't directly use IDC scripts generated by Delphi IDR, so you first need to create an IDC file using Delphi IDR, then run the DhrakeInit.java script using Ghidra Script Manager. See [Dhrake How To] on how to use it.

Once the GhidraInit code finish running, you can use Script Manager to run this script. The difference between this script and DhrakeParseClass.java is that this script automatically search for all VMT_* symbols and execute the DhrakeParseClass for each of them, instead of you having to do it manually.

Once the script finish, you should have all the new classes and methods listed in the Symbol tree view in Ghidra.

***This script is provided as-is. Please make sure to backup your Ghidra project before running the script.***
